Post gratuated in Business and Marketing and specialization in Coaching, PNL and Leadership Team, I have always tried to explore different areas seeing the fact that I could understand the companies from different points of view. 

I worked in national and international companies as Sales Analyst, Customer Service Insights and Customer Service Team Leader.

I adapt easly to different types of environments. I am trustworthy, analytical, responsable, social, driven, eager to learn, like to work in a team and goal oriented. I'm comfortable to take the lead and work autonomously without supervision when required. Also I like to be active in my spare time, swimming and play volleyball are examples.
