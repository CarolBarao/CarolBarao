### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having worked as a Country Team Lead with over 15 years of experience in Marketing, Sales, Commercial Customer Insights and Translations. A strong Marketing Professional with a B.A. in Administration and Marketing and an MBA in Strategic Business. 

In constant learning, to complete my challenges I'm starting in the area of Bootcamp Programming as a personal challenge, where I'm learning the languages  of HTML, CSS3 and Javascript, and Iâ€™m starting my first projects.

I am goal orienated and analytical in my approach to my career. I believe strongly in team-work and being eagar to learn everyday but am very comfortable to take the lead and work autonomously without supervision when required.
